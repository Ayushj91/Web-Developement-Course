# Web-Developement-Course
DOM1:
Here I learnt the basics of dom manipulation, basic attributes like querySelector, createElement, appendChild in parent(eg body), addEventListener(we can set function it'll perform on an action(eg click, doubleclick, etc)) and how to get and alter innerText from an html attribute.

DOM2:
Here I learnt more about querySelectorAll(it is in continuation of querySelector, here, we can select multiple elements, it'll be represented in 0-indexed array format) and about insertBefore attribute.

DOM3:
here I learnt about getAttribute and setAttribute, also classList(array representation), also made a project where boxes change to specified data-color on double click and simultaneously set it's class to used, so as to show that it's already been set.

DOM4:
Here I learnt more about how to access style attributes with Javascript.
